title: Hospital Heroes Get Nourished

---
Thank you to Penn Medicineâ€™s Center for Health Care Innovation for inviting ICON to support their initiative to nourish frontline hospital staff. We were delighted to contribute the time of our team members, even in a small way, to support the development of a platform designed to feed frontline hospital heroes in a safe and affordable way during the COVID-19 pandemic. The program is being piloted at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center where hospital staff can sign up to text orders to local restaurants for delivery of healthy food options. Congratulations to Penn Medicine's Center for Health Care Innovation for this innovative program serving front line workers and providing much needed support to local restaurants.
