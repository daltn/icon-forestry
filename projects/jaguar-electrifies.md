introduction: "<h3>ICON HELPS LAUNCH JAGUAR'S FIRST FULLY-ELECTRIC VEHICLE</h3><p></p><p>With
  a world-class foray into the electric vehicle (EV) marketplace, Jaguar wanted to
  take the U.S. market by storm. So that's just what we did.</p>"

brief_label: Challenge
brief: "<p>Dream up and execute an attention-grabbing tour that would raise awareness
  and interest in the I-Pace.</p>"
solution_label: Solution
solution: <p>ICON proposed a series of Video and Photo spots that would be used both
  internally and externally to generate a buzz around the launch.</p><p>The first
  shoot was a vehicle convoy “flash mob” around San Francisco during the Global Climate
  Summit that drove by several key landmarks. This took place three months before
  the vehicle went on sale. We used this opportunity to capture hero images for their
  marketing plans, social media, and PR/communications.</p><p>This video had a call
  to action that drove people to sign up for the Jaguar Electrifies tour that started
  in San Francisco a few weeks later. The tour was a full experience that featured
  ride and drives, social sharable moments, and new technologies that were showcased
  by Wired Magazine.</p><p>The tour stopped in San Francisco, Miami, and Los Angeles.</p><p>The
  events were such a success, that Jaguar decided to create an abbreviated version
  of the tour experience at a number of major Auto Shows including LA, Chicago, and
  Washington DC.</p><p>In 2019, the I-Pace went on to win "World Car of the Year,”
  “World Green Car of the Year,” and "World Car Design of the Year”—a clean sweep
  from the World Car Awards (WCA).</p>
